* Technical Notes
** README
*** General:
   - This file corresponds to my lab book for my doctoral thesis tackling
     artifact correction in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)
     measurements using Deep Neural Networks. It also contains notes taken
     during the process of setting up this workflow for reproducible research.
   - This file contains explanations of how things are organized, of the
     workflow for doing experiments, changes made to the code, and the observed
     behavior in the "* Data" section.
   - The branching model used is described in [[http://starpu-simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/misc/SIGOPS_paper.pdf][this paper]]. Therefore: if you
     are interested in the "* Data" section, you have to =git clone= the /data/
     branch of the repository. The /main/ branch is clean from any results, it
     contains only source code and the analysis.
   - This project is my take on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science][Open-notebook science]]. The idea was postulated in
     a blog post in 2006:
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     ... there is a URL to a laboratory notebook that is freely available and
     indexed on common search engines. It does not necessarily have to look like
     a paper notebook but it is essential that all of the information available
     to the researchers to make their conclusions is equally available to the
     rest of the world ---Jean-Claude Bradley
     #+END_QUOTE
   - Proposal on how to deal with truly private data (e.g. notes from a
     confidential meeting with a colleague), which might otherwise be noted in a
     normal Lab notebook: do not include them here. Only notes relevant to the
     current project should be taken

*** Experiments workflow:
   1) Create a new branch from =main=
   2) Print out the git log from the latest commit and the metadata
   3) Call the analysis scripts, follow the principles outlined in
      [[* Organization of code]]
   4) All machine learning runs are saved in =data/mlruns=, all other data in
      =data/#experiment-name=
   5) Add a "** #experiment-name" section to this file under [[* Data]]
   6) Commit/push the results of this separate branch
   7) Merge this new branch with the remote =data= branch

**** SSH tunneling
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ssh-tunneling
    :END:

    Different applications can be run on the remote compute node. If I want to
    access them at the local machine, and open them with the browser, I use this
    tunneling script.

    #+NAME: ssh-tunnel
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session org-tunnel :var port="8889" :var node="node001"
    ssh -t -t ara -L $port:localhost:$port ssh $node -L $port:Localhost:$port
    #+END_SRC

    Apps I use that way:
    - Jupyter lab for running Python 3-Kernels
    - TensorBoard
    - Mlflow ui

**** jupyter scripts
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: scripts-jp
    :END:

    Starting a jupyter instance on a server where the necessary libraries are
    installed is easy using this script:

    #+NAME: jpt-tmux
    #+BEGIN_SRC tmux :socket ~/.tmux-local-socket-remote-machine
    conda activate tf
    export PORT=9999
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=''
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=""
    jupyter lab --no-browser --port=$PORT
    #+END_SRC

    On the compute node of the HPC, the users' environment is managed through
    module files using the system [[https://lmod.readthedocs.io][Lmod]]. The =export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR= statements
    are needed because of a jupyter bug which did not let it start. Right now,
    =ob-tmux= does not support a =:var= header like normal =org-babel= does. So
    the =$port= variable has to be set here in the template.

    Now this port has to be tunnelled on our local computer (See
    [[#ssh-tunneling]]). While the tmux session above keeps running, no matter if
    Emacs is running or not, this following ssh tunnel needs to be active
    locally to connect to the notebook. If you close Emacs, it would need to be
    reestablished

*** Setup notes
**** Setting up a tmux connection from using =ob-tmux= in =org-babel=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sec-tmux-setup
    :END:
    - prerequisite: tmux versions need to be the same locally and on the server.
      Let's verify that now.
      - the local tmux version:

        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        tmux -V
        #+END_SRC

        #+RESULTS:
        : tmux 3.0a

      - the remote tmux version:

       #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session local
        ssh ara tmux -V
      #+END_SRC

        #+RESULTS:
        | ye53nis@ara-login01.rz.uni-jena.de's | password: |
        | tmux                                 | 3.0a      |

    - as is described in [[https://github.com/ahendriksen/ob-tmux][the ob-tmux readme]], the following code snippet creates
      a socket on the remote machine and forwards this socket to the local
      machine (note that =socket_path= was introduced in tmux version 2.2)

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session local
      REMOTE_SOCKET=$(ssh ara 'tmux ls -F "#{socket_path}"' | head -1)
      echo $REMOTE_SOCKET
      ssh ara -tfN \
          -L ~/.tmux-local-socket-remote-machine:$REMOTE_SOCKET
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      | ye53nis@ara-login01.rz.uni-jena.de's | password:                            |           |
      | /tmp/tmux-67339/default              |                                      |           |
      | >                                    | ye53nis@ara-login01.rz.uni-jena.de's | password: |

    - now a new tmux session with name =ob-NAME= is created when using a code
      block which looks like this: =#+BEGIN_SRC tmux :socket
      ~/.tmux-local-socket-remote-machine :session NAME=
    - Commands can be sent now to the remote tmux session, BUT note that the
      output is not printed yet
    - there is a workaround for getting output back to our LabBook.org: A [[#scripts-tmux][script]]
      which allows to print the output from the tmux session in an
      =#+begin_example=-Block below the tmux block by pressing =C-c C-o= or =C-c
      C-v C-o= when the pointer is inside the tmux block.

**** =emacs-jupyter= Setup

    =Emacs-jupyter= aims to be an API for a lot of functionalities of the
    =jupyter= project. The documentation can be found on [[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter][GitHub]].

    1. For the *whole document*: connect to a running jupyter instance
       1. =M-x jupyter-server-list-kernels=
          1. set server URL, e.g. =http://localhost:8889=
          2. set websocket URL, e.g. =http://localhost:8889=
       2. two possibilities
          1. kernel already exists $\to$ list of kernels and =kernel-ID= is displayed
          2. kernel does not exist $\to$ prompt asks if you want to start one $\to$
             *yes* $\to$ type kernel you want to start, e.g. =Python 3=
    2. In the *subtree* where you want to use =jupyter-python= blocks with =org
       babel=
       1. set the =:header-args:jupyter-python :session
          /jpy:localhost#kernel:8889-ID=
       2. customize the output folder using the following org-mode variable:
          #+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
            (setq org-babel-jupyter-resource-directory "./data/exp-test/plots")
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          : ./data/exp-test/plots
    3. For each *individual block*, the following customizations might be useful
       1. jupyter kernels can return multiple kinds of rich output (images,
          html, ...) or scalar data (plain text, numbers, lists, ...). To force
          a plain output, use =:results scalar=. To show the output in the
          minibuffer only, use =:results silent=
       2. to change the priority of different rich outputs, use =:display=
          header argument, e.g. =:display text/plain text/html= prioritizes
          plain text over html. All supported mimetypes in default order:
          1. text/org
          2. image/svg+xml, image/jpeg, image/png
          3. text/html
          4. text/markdown
          5. text/latex
          6. text/plain
       3. We can set jupyter to output pandas DataFrames as org tables
          automatically using the source block header argument =:pandoc t=
       4. useful keybindings
          - =M-i= to open the documentation for wherever your pointer is (like
            pressing =Shift-TAB= in Jupyter notebooks)
          - =C-c C-i= to interrupt the kernel, =C-c C-r= to restart the kernel

*** Notes on archiving
**** Exporting the LabBook.org to html in a twbs style
     - I am partial to the twitter bootstrap theme of html, since I like it's
       simple design, but clear structure with a nice table of contents at the
       side → the following org mode extension supports a seemless export to
       twitter bootstrap html: https://github.com/marsmining/ox-twbs
     - when installed, the export can be triggered via the command
       =(org-twbs-export-as-html)= or via the keyboard shortcut for export =C-c
       C-e= followed by =w= for Twitter bootstrap and =h= for saving the .html
     - _Things to configure:_
       - in general, there are multiple export options:
         https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html
       - E.g. I set 2 =#+OPTIONS= keywords at the begin of the file: =toc:4= and
         =H:4= which make sure that in my export my sidebar table of contents
         will show numbered headings till a depth of 4.
       - I configured my code blocks so that they will not be evaluated when
         exporting (I would recommend this especially if you only export for
         archiving) and that both the code block and the output will be exported
         with the keyword: =#+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export :exports
         both=
       - To discriminate between code blocks for different languages I gave each
         of them a distinct colour using =#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <style...= (see
         above)
     - _Things to do before exporting / Troubleshooting while exporting:_
       - when using a dark theme for you emacs, the export of the code blocks
         might show some ugly dark backgrounds from the theme. If this becomes
         an issue, change to a light theme for the export
       - only in the =data= branch you set the git tags after merging. If you
         want to show them here, execute the corresponding function in [[Git TAGs]]
       - make sure your file links work properly! I recommend referencing your
         files relatively (e.g. [ [ f ile:./data/exp-XXXXXX-test/test.png]]
         without spaces). Otherwise there will be errors in your /*Messages*/
         buffer
       - There might be errors with your code blocks
         - e.g. the export function expects you to assign a default variable to
           your functions
         - if you call a function via the =#+CALL= mechanism, it wants you to
           include two parentheses for the function, e.g. =#+CALL: test()=
     - _Things to do after exporting:_
       - In my workflow, I put the exported =LabBook.html= into the =data=
         folder. If you move the file, you will have to fix the file links for
         the new location, e.g. via "Find and replace" =M-%= with find:
         =[[file:./data/= and replace: =[[=
** Organization of git

*** remote/origin/main branch:
  - contains all the source code in folder **src/** which is used for experiments.
  - contains the **LabBook.org** template
  - contains setup- and metadata files such as **MLproject** or **conda.yaml**
  - the log contains only lasting alterations on the folders and files mentioned
    above, which are e.g. used for conducting experiments or which introduce new
    features. Day-to-day changes in code
*** remote/origin/exp### branches:
  - if an experiment is done, the code and templates will be branched out from
    *main* in an *#experiment-name* branch, ### meaning some meaningful
    descriptor.
  - all data generated during the experiment (e.g. .csv files, plots, images,
    etc), is stored in a folder with the name **data/#experiment-name**, except
    machine learning-specific data and metadata from `mlflow` runs, which are
    saved under **data/mlruns** (this allows easily comparing machine learning
    runs with different experimental settings)
  - The **LabBook.org** file is essential
    - If possible, all code is executed from inside this file (meaning analysis
      scripts or calling the code from the **scr/** directory).
    - All other steps taken during an experiment are noted down, as well as
      conclusions or my thought process while conducting the experiment
    - Provenance data, such as Metadata about the environment the code was
      executed in, the command line output of the code, and some
*** remote/origin/develop branch:
  - this is the branch I use for day to day work on features and exploration.
    All of my current activity can be followed here.
*** remote/origin/data branch:
  - contains a full cronicle of the whole research process
  - all *#experiment-name* branches are merged here. Afterwards the original
    branch is deleted and on the data branch there is a *Git tag* which shows
    the merge commit to make accessing single experiments easy.
  - the *develop* branch is merged here as well.

*** Git TAGs

          commit aa5b9bc35c53c4fd1525c6b812b2a28532ae7afb
          Author: Apoplex <oligolex@vivaldi.net>
          Date:   Sat Aug 7 22:15:02 2021 +0200

              Add hparams combi restriction; add metadata

              problems arise, if in the random combination of hparams, 2*pool_size**n_levels
              is bigger than the input_size. That's why these cases are skipped now.

     4. Show tree of input files used. I made a design choice in simulating
        these files, which I now regret: I simulated 10 files for each speed of
        molecules (0.069, 0.08, 0.1, ...), but I *randomly* chose the clusters.
        In hindsight, the cluster speed creates vastly different artifact
        shapes, which may have implications for the training. Thats why I
        manually created different splits of train and val data.

**** Mlflow run 1 (failed mid run)
     - Use =firstartifact_Nov2020_train_max2sets= and
       =firstartifact_Nov2020_val_max2sets_SORTEDIN= to get a good equilibrium
       between amount of training data (max1set would maybe be not enough) and
       equal distribution of artifacts (max3sets might give too much weight to
       slow clusters with 0.1 speed, because a lot of them were simulated). Note
       that the #+RESULTS section was too long, that's why not everything is
       printed (but logged in MLFLOW of course)

              Add hparams combi restriction; add metadata

              problems arise, if in the random combination of hparams, 2*pool_size**n_levels
              is bigger than the input_size. That's why these cases are skipped now.

     2. system and conda env didn't change, see above.

**** Mlflow run 2 (failed mid run)
     - The last parent run failed to an unkown error (=bash: line 1: 36008
       Segmentation fault=). That means only 63/140 sessions could be run, while
       also only 45 sessions were eligible (for the rest, the hparams were not
       compatible with each other). Still, these first 45 runs delivered a lot
       of interesting information, so I decided to skim through MLflow to look
       for improvements in the hparam space and I came up with the following:
       - leave out smallest batch sizes and go from 4 to 30
       - make number of levels an integer interval from 1 to 9
       - make first filters an integer interval from 1 to 128
       - add pool_size (+ stride + kernel size) 8
       - adjust starting learning rate real interval to 1e-6 to 0.06
       - make learning rate power integer interval from 1 to 7
     - now the run:

    1. Out of convenience, I used Mlflowui to compare the two runs with all
       parameters and metrics. Since a nice exporting option was missing, I
       copied the comparison into libreoffice calc by hand and saved it as a
       csv. Now lets load it and print the validation AUC as an example.

    2. I ran each hparams run twice for each random parameter sample. As a
       minimal statistical move, lets take the average of the metrics which have
       2 identical parameter runs. Unfortunately, one run is only single, since
       the program crashed. We have to remove it and later add it again.

       but especially a high Recall as well:

         cond3 = run1_2_combimetrics.loc['val_precision0.5'] > 0.85

         with pd.option_context('display.max_rows', None, 'display.max_columns', None):  # more options can be specified also
             display(run1_2_combiparams.loc[:, cond1 & cond2 & cond3])

       This looks promising with a wide variety of approaches leading to
       success. Sadly, only run =00f2635d9fa2463c9a066722163405be= had the model
       saved out for immediate testing. The other models have to be trained
       again with the same settings.

       Lets look at some plots of successful runs as well:
       High validation AUC:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_highvalauc.png
       High validation AUC, high validation precision:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_highvalauc-highvalprecision.png
       High validation AUC, high validation recall:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_highvalauc-highvalrecall.png
       High validation AUC, high validation recall, high validation precision:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_highvalauc-highvalrecall-highvalprecision.png

    4. Now lets look at some unsuccessful runs and some interesting runs:
       High training AUC, low validation AUC (these models overfitted). Here a
       clear predictor seems to be ~lr_power=1~, a small batch size, and a small
       pool size.
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_highauc-lowvalauc.png
       Low validation AUC, low validation recall:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_lowvalrecall-lowvalauc.png
       Low validation precision, but still reasonably high validation AUC:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_lowvalprecision-highvalauc.png
       Low validation recall, but still reasonably high validation AUC:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_lowvalrecall-highvalauc.png

    5. Lets inspect input sizes. Their might be a slight preference for 2**14
       length of traces, but it could also be negligible.
       Input size of 4096 time steps
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_input-size_4096.png
       Input size of 8192 time steps
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_input-size_8192.png
       Input size of 16384 time steps
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_input-size_16384.png

    6. Next lets inspect a complicated hyperparameter, which adjusts the pool
       size of the encoder, as well as the strides and the kernel size of the
       decoder. It is connected to the input size and n_levels in model
       building, as well. The following condition has to hold: ~input_size >=
       2 * pool_size**n_levels~. Because of that, a pool_size of 8 is only
       possible with smaller n_levels. Still, a higher pool_size seems to be
       useful in this project.
       pool size, kernel size and strides of 2:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_poolsize-strides-kernelsize_2.png
       pool size, kernel size and strides of 4:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_poolsize-strides-kernelsize_4.png
       pool size, kernel size and strides of 8:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_poolsize-strides-kernelsize_8.png

    7. Another complicated hyperparameter is n_levels. It refers to the "depth"
       of the unet. How many times will the input trace be pooled and skip
       connections made? This parameter strongly influences the amount of total
       model parameters and smaller values make the model much more portable and
       "simpler", which could be viewed as a positive thing itself. A larger
       value raises the learning capacity of the network, but also raises the
       possibility of overfitting.
       Number of unet levels 1 to 3
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_n-levels_1-3.png
       Number of unet levels 4 to 6
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_n-levels_4-6.png
       Number of unet levels 7 to 9
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_n-levels_7-9.png

    8. Lets take a look at the different first filters (starting from this
       value, the number of filters was doubled for each unet level till a
       maximum of 512 filters was reached). More filters mean more capacity for
       learning, but also more risk of overfitting and model size. Here, no real
       trend is visible, so a lower number of filters should be sufficient.
       from 6 to 45 first filters
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_first-filters_6-45.png
       from 57 to 77 first filters
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_first-filters_57-77.png
       from 100 to 128 first filters
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_first-filters_100-128.png

    9. Now lets take a look at the starting learning rates and the learning rate
       power, which together are used to construct a learning rate schedule. For
       the learning rate starting value, the lower category seemed to perform
       better than the upper category. The power of 1 is simpler than the values
       between 4 and 7.
       Start learning rate between 0.0065 and 0.035:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_lr-start_0.0065-0.035.png
       Start learning rate between 0.045 and 0.065:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_lr-start_0.045-0.065.png
       Start learning rate between 0.065 and 0.1:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_lr-start_0.065-0.1.png
       Power of learning rate equation = 1, meaning a linear decay:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_lr-power_1.png
       Power of learning rate equation = 4 to 7, meaning a polynomial decay:
       file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_lr-power_2-7.png

    10. The next parameter is the batch size, which is directly coupled to the
        steps per epoch of the training (since I chose the step size to equal
        the total number of examples divided by the batch size). A larger batch
        size pools more training examples for decisions. We see that batch size
        >7 seem to be benefitial.
        Batch size of 2 to 8, with steps per epoch between 600 and 2400
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_batch-size_2-8_higher-steps-per-epoch.png
        Batch size of 8 to 20, with steps per epoch between 165 and 550
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_batch-size_8-20_lower-steps-per-epoch.png

    11. Lastly, lets take a look at the different scalers. I used a scaler from
        the beginning, because in learning algorithms this guarantees some
        numerical stability. As a naive approach I chose one - the Min-Max
        scaler. After evaluating the first training approaches I noticed that
        there might be problems with this scaler, if the trace has no artifacts
        in it, see this example plot:
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/jupyter/scalers_minmax-problem.png
        First I plotted a variety of scalers from =sklearn= on some simulated
        data:
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/jupyter/scalers_simulations.png
        From these I chose Standard, Robust, Max-Abs, Quantile (Gaussian),
        Min-Max, L1 and L2, because they looked most promising. Now, let's load
        some of the experimental data and see how these scalers look on this
        data.

        with =reshape(-1, 1)= to say that *data has a single feature*
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/jupyter/scalers_experimental.png . We
        already see that the quantile transformation might not be so useful
        here. In the simulated data with slower cluster speeds it made the peaks
        clearly distinct, here this is not the case.

        using =reshape(1, -1)= to say that data contains a single sample does
        not work e.g. each timestep normalized to 0...

        First, let's look at L1 and L2. L1 was only chosen once, L2 got chosen
        more often. In runs with the highest =val_auc=, this norm especially
        seems to lead to a high recall (which is a problem with minmax). But we
        also see that depending on the other parameters there is a wide
        variation of results, including very bad ones
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_scaler_l1.png
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_scaler_l2.png

        Second, let's look at Max-Abs (from 0 to the maximum value) and Min-Max
        (from the minimum to the maximum value). Both are conceptually somewhat
        similar, although Max-Abs keeps the distance from 0 to the minimal
        value, and Min-Max does not. We see that both lead to good results, with
        some variation. In Max-Abs, the spread seems to be wider.
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_scaler_maxabs.png
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_scaler_minmax.png

        Third, Quantile Transformation (Gaussian distribution). We see that this
        transformation suffers from bad val_precision values. Higher recall
        values can be reached with other transformations. Thus, I think I can
        neglect this transformation in the future.
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_scaler_quant-g.png

        Fourth, the Robust Scaler. It robustly (haha) achieves good precision
        and recall values
        file:./data/exp-210807-hparams/mlflow/run1-2_scaler_robust.png

        Fifth, the Standard Scaler. It achieves some of the best results, even
        though there is some variation, both in precision and recall.

       Good news! This time there are no =nan= values. In =exp-210204-unet=, we
       had 31 of them in the =clean= dataset with pred-0.1, which suggested a
       lot of false positives in the clean data, which led to traces shorter
       than 32 time steps, where the multipletau algorithm fails. Still, I am
       not sure why the metadata was not saved out in the correlation program. I
       will investigate another time...

       First of all: the extension of simulated training data clearly helped to
       avoid the enormous amount of false positives in the run
       =exp-210204-unet= in folder =0=. Here, only few traces are shortened,
       which is to be expected, since it represents a negative control. Looking
       at folder =1=, the reduction of trace length increased with all
       prediction thresholds. I later plot trace length vs tau to see if this
       reduction in trace length introduces artifacts or if it is mainly a
       desired outcome of more found artifacts.

       For me, this plot shows that the reduction of trace length is not too
       severe even with low prediction thresholds. Also, the reduction in trace
       length mainly seems to be due to better recognition of artifacts.

       Check out the trace lengths. The reduction seems similar over all simulated
       data. This speaks to a good generalization. Compared to =exp-210204-unet=,
       there is especially an improvement in the Simulated D of 0.1, and 0.4 to 50 and
       Simulated $D_{clust}$ of 0.01.

    3. Now let's take a look at the diffrates and transit times. Since the
       distribution follows a log normal, use a log scale.

               palette='colorblind',

       We see again a strong improvement in $D_{clust} = 0.01$, this time with
       all simulated $D$. We also see that there are occasional outliers in the
       prediction group (e.g. $D = 50$ and $D_{clust} = 0.01$), but the
       statistics are in general okay now.

       Still things to look out for: for $D=50$ we see a slight distortion to
       lower transit times / faster diffrates, in both reduction by label _and_
       prediction. Here seems to lie a boundary of the correction method.

    4. Lastly, let's take a look at a scatterplot of transit times vs trace
       lengths using a subsample to avoid overplotting.

         corr_scatter = corr_out[corr_out['Traces used'].isin(['corrected by labels (control)', 'corrected by prediction'])].sample(1000)

       We see that the distribution for $D$ starts to spread out after rougly 10% of a
       trace has been deleted. The traces which had the most artifacts in them
       and thus were corrected most, were with a $D_{clust}$ of 0.01.

*** Learnings from run 1 and 2
    - I need to fix the fitting algorithm - as can be seen in <exp-...> the
      binning to 100um is not sufficient to correlate the plateau, thus we fit
      only the tail. This could be one reason why we get an average / median
      transit time of 0.5ms for uncorrupted traces, even though Pablo fitted
      0.225ms in FOCUSpoint.
    - Boundary of correction method seems to be D=50, here correction by label
      _and_ correction by prediction reduce the transit times _too much_, as in
      the achieved transit times are too low / diffrates are too fast.
