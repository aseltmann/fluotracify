** General:
   - This file corresponds to my lab book for my doctoral thesis tackling
     artifact correction in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)
     measurements using Deep Neural Networks
   - It contains explanations of how things are organized, of the workflow for
     doing experiments, changes made to the code, and the observed behavior in
     the "* Data" section.
   - The branching model used is described in [[http://starpu-simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/misc/SIGOPS_paper.pdf][this paper]]. Following this, if you
     are interested in the "* Data" section, you have to =git clone= the /data/
     branch. The /master/ branch is clean from any results, it contains only
     source code and the analysis.
** Experiments workflow:
   1) Create a new branch
   2) Make sure everything is commited
   3) ...
   4) Do the analysis
   5) Add to this file into "* Data" section the entry for the results, using
      the template described below
   6) Commit/push the results of this separate branch
   7) Merge this new branch with the remote "data" branch
** Example for simulation...
** Example for ...
** Example for ...
* Template for data entry:
** xp#
*** git:
#+begin_src sh
git log -1
#+end_src
*** Notes:
    ######################
* Organization of git
** remote/origin/master branch:
   - Has all the source, analysis, scripts
** remote/origin/xp# branches:
   - Have all the data connected to specific experiments
   - Also some important (not all) .pdf files
** remote/origin/data branch:
   - Merging all the data and source branches
   - It is cloned only on my local machine, never clone it on a remote one
