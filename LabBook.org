* Technical Notes
** README
*** General:
   - This file corresponds to my lab book for my doctoral thesis tackling
     artifact correction in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)
     measurements using Deep Neural Networks. It also contains notes taken
     during the process of setting up this workflow for reproducible research.
   - This file contains explanations of how things are organized, of the
     workflow for doing experiments, changes made to the code, and the observed
     behavior in the "* Data" section.
   - The branching model used is described in [[http://starpu-simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/misc/SIGOPS_paper.pdf][this paper]]. Therefore: if you
     are interested in the "* Data" section, you have to =git clone= the /data/
     branch of the repository. The /main/ branch is clean from any results, it
     contains only source code and the analysis.
   - This project is my take on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science][Open-notebook science]]. The idea was postulated in
     a blog post in 2006:
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     ... there is a URL to a laboratory notebook that is freely available and
     indexed on common search engines. It does not necessarily have to look like
     a paper notebook but it is essential that all of the information available
     to the researchers to make their conclusions is equally available to the
     rest of the world ---Jean-Claude Bradley
     #+END_QUOTE
   - Proposal on how to deal with truly private data (e.g. notes from a
     confidential meeting with a colleague), which might otherwise be noted in a
     normal Lab notebook: do not include them here. Only notes relevant to the
     current project should be taken
*** Code block languages used in this document

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     # This is a sh block for shell / bash scripting. In the context of this file,
     # these blocks are mainly used for operations on my local computer.
     # In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     # light green colour (#F0FBE9)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC tmux
     # This block can open and access tmux sessions, used for shell scripting on
     # remote computing clusters.
     # In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     # distinct light green colour (#E1EED8)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     # This is a python block. In the context of this file, it is seldomly used
     # (only for examplary scripts.)
     # In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     # light blue colour (#E6EDF4)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session /jpy:localhost#8889:704d35be-572a-4268-a70b-565164b8620f
     # This is a jupyter-python block. The code is sent to a jupyter kernel running
     # on a remote high performance computing cluster. Most of my jupyter code is
     # executed this way.
     # In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     # light orange colour (#FAEAE1)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; This is a emacs-lisp block, the language used to customize Emacs, which is
     ;; sometimes necessary, since the reproducible workflow of this LabBook is
     ;; tightly integrated with Emacs and org-mode.
     ;; In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     ;; light violet colour (#F7ECFB)
   #+END_SRC

   #+begin_example
     This is a literal example block. It can be used very flexibly - in the context
     of this document the output of most code blocks is displayed this way.
     In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a light
     yellow colour (#FBFBBF)
   #+end_example

   #+begin_details
   #+begin_example
     This is a literal example block enclosed in a details block. This is useful to
     make the page more readable by collapsing large amounts of output.
     In the Labbook.html rendering of this document, the details block will have a
     light grey colour (#f0f0f0) and a pink color when hovering above it.

*** Experiments workflow:
   1) Create a new branch from =main=
   2) Print out the git log from the latest commit and the metadata
   3) Call the analysis scripts, follow the principles outlined in
      [[* Organization of code]]
   4) All machine learning runs are saved in =data/mlruns=, all other data in
      =data/#experiment-name=
   5) Add a ~** exp-<date>-<name>~" section to this file under [[* Data]]
   6) Commit/push the results of this separate branch
   7) Merge this new branch with the remote =data= branch

**** SSH tunneling
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ssh-tunneling
    :END:

    Different applications can be run on the remote compute node. If I want to
    access them at the local machine, and open them with the browser, I use this
    tunneling script.

    #+NAME: ssh-tunnel
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session org-tunnel :var port="8889" :var node="node001"
    ssh -t -t ara -L $port:localhost:$port ssh $node -L $port:Localhost:$port
    #+END_SRC

    Apps I use that way:
    - Jupyter lab for running Python 3-Kernels
    - TensorBoard
    - Mlflow ui

**** jupyter scripts
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: scripts-jp
    :END:

    Starting a jupyter instance on a server where the necessary libraries are
    installed is easy using this script:

    #+NAME: jpt-tmux
    #+BEGIN_SRC tmux :socket ~/.tmux-local-socket-remote-machine
    conda activate tf
    export PORT=8889
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=''
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=""
    jupyter lab --no-browser --port=$PORT
    #+END_SRC

    On the compute node of the HPC, the users' environment is managed through
    module files using the system [[https://lmod.readthedocs.io][Lmod]]. The =export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR= statements
    are needed because of a jupyter bug which did not let it start. Right now,
    =ob-tmux= does not support a =:var= header like normal =org-babel= does. So
    the =$port= variable has to be set here in the template.

    Now this port has to be tunnelled on our local computer (See
    [[#ssh-tunneling]]). While the tmux session above keeps running, no matter if
    Emacs is running or not, this following ssh tunnel needs to be active
    locally to connect to the notebook. If you close Emacs, it would need to be
    reestablished

*** Setup notes
**** Setting up a tmux connection from using =ob-tmux= in =org-babel=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sec-tmux-setup
    :END:
    - prerequisite: tmux versions need to be the same locally and on the server.
      Let's verify that now.
      - the local tmux version:

        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        tmux -V
        #+END_SRC

        #+RESULTS:
        : tmux 3.0a

      - the remote tmux version:

       #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session local
        ssh ara tmux -V
      #+END_SRC

        #+RESULTS:
        | ye53nis@ara-login01.rz.uni-jena.de's | password: |
        | tmux                                 | 3.0a      |

    - as is described in [[https://github.com/ahendriksen/ob-tmux][the ob-tmux readme]], the following code snippet creates
      a socket on the remote machine and forwards this socket to the local
      machine (note that =socket_path= was introduced in tmux version 2.2)

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session local
      REMOTE_SOCKET=$(ssh ara 'tmux ls -F "#{socket_path}"' | head -1)
      echo $REMOTE_SOCKET
      ssh ara -tfN \
          -L ~/.tmux-local-socket-remote-machine:$REMOTE_SOCKET
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      | ye53nis@ara-login01.rz.uni-jena.de's | password:                            |           |
      | /tmp/tmux-67339/default              |                                      |           |
      | >                                    | ye53nis@ara-login01.rz.uni-jena.de's | password: |

    - now a new tmux session with name =ob-NAME= is created when using a code
      block which looks like this: =#+BEGIN_SRC tmux :socket
      ~/.tmux-local-socket-remote-machine :session NAME=
    - Commands can be sent now to the remote tmux session, BUT note that the
      output is not printed yet
    - there is a workaround for getting output back to our LabBook.org: A [[#scripts-tmux][script]]
      which allows to print the output from the tmux session in an
      =#+begin_example=-Block below the tmux block by pressing =C-c C-o= or =C-c
      C-v C-o= when the pointer is inside the tmux block.

**** =emacs-jupyter= Setup

    =Emacs-jupyter= aims to be an API for a lot of functionalities of the
    =jupyter= project. The documentation can be found on [[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter][GitHub]].

    1. For the *whole document*: connect to a running jupyter instance
       1. =M-x jupyter-server-list-kernels=
          1. set server URL, e.g. =http://localhost:8889=
          2. set websocket URL, e.g. =http://localhost:8889=
       2. two possibilities
          1. kernel already exists $\to$ list of kernels and =kernel-ID= is displayed
          2. kernel does not exist $\to$ prompt asks if you want to start one $\to$
             *yes* $\to$ type kernel you want to start, e.g. =Python 3=
    2. In the *subtree* where you want to use =jupyter-python= blocks with =org
       babel=
       1. set the =:header-args:jupyter-python :session
          /jpy:localhost#kernel:8889-ID=
       2. customize the output folder using the following org-mode variable:
          #+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
            (setq org-babel-jupyter-resource-directory "./data/exp-test/plots")
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          : ./data/exp-test/plots
    3. For each *individual block*, the following customizations might be useful
       1. jupyter kernels can return multiple kinds of rich output (images,
          html, ...) or scalar data (plain text, numbers, lists, ...). To force
          a plain output, use =:results scalar=. To show the output in the
          minibuffer only, use =:results silent=
       2. to change the priority of different rich outputs, use =:display=
          header argument, e.g. =:display text/plain text/html= prioritizes
          plain text over html. All supported mimetypes in default order:
          1. text/org
          2. image/svg+xml, image/jpeg, image/png
          3. text/html
          4. text/markdown
          5. text/latex
          6. text/plain
       3. We can set jupyter to output pandas DataFrames as org tables
          automatically using the source block header argument =:pandoc t=
       4. useful keybindings
          - =M-i= to open the documentation for wherever your pointer is (like
            pressing =Shift-TAB= in Jupyter notebooks)
          - =C-c C-i= to interrupt the kernel, =C-c C-r= to restart the kernel

*** Notes on archiving
**** Exporting the LabBook.org to html in a twbs style
     - I am partial to the twitter bootstrap theme of html, since I like it's
       simple design, but clear structure with a nice table of contents at the
       side → the following org mode extension supports a seemless export to
       twitter bootstrap html: https://github.com/marsmining/ox-twbs
     - when installed, the export can be triggered via the command
       =(org-twbs-export-as-html)= or via the keyboard shortcut for export =C-c
       C-e= followed by =w= for Twitter bootstrap and =h= for saving the .html
     - _Things to configure:_
       - in general, there are multiple export options:
         https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html
       - E.g. I set 2 =#+OPTIONS= keywords at the begin of the file: =toc:4= and
         =H:4= which make sure that in my export my sidebar table of contents
         will show numbered headings till a depth of 4.
       - I configured my code blocks so that they will not be evaluated when
         exporting (I would recommend this especially if you only export for
         archiving) and that both the code block and the output will be exported
         with the keyword: =#+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export :exports
         both=
       - To discriminate between code blocks for different languages I gave each
         of them a distinct colour using =#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <style...= (see
         above)
     - _Things to do before exporting / Troubleshooting while exporting:_
       - when using a dark theme for you emacs, the export of the code blocks
         might show some ugly dark backgrounds from the theme. If this becomes
         an issue, change to a light theme for the export with =M-x
         (load-theme)= and choose =solarized-light=
       - only in the =data= branch you set the git tags after merging. If you
         want to show them here, execute the corresponding function in [[Git TAGs]]
       - make sure your file links work properly! I recommend referencing your
         files relatively (e.g. [ [ f ile:./data/exp-XXXXXX-test/test.png]]
         without spaces). Otherwise there will be errors in your /*Messages*/
         buffer
       - There might be errors with your code blocks
         - e.g. the export function expects you to assign a default variable to
           your functions
         - if you call a function via the =#+CALL= mechanism, it wants you to
           include two parentheses for the function, e.g. =#+CALL: test()=
       - check indentation of code blocks inside lists
       - add a =details= block around large output cells. This makes them
         expandable. I added some =#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <style...= inspired by
         [[https://alhassy.github.io/org-special-block-extras/#Folded-Details][alhassy]]. That's how the =details= block looks like:
         #+begin_example
         #+begin_details

         #+end_details
         #+end_example
       - If you reference a parameter with an underscore in the name, use the
         org markdown tricks to style them like code (~==~ or =~~=), otherwise
         the part after the underscore will be rendered like a subscript:
         =under_score= vs under_score
     - _Things to do after exporting:_
       - In my workflow, I put the exported =LabBook.html= into the =data=
         folder. If you move the file, you will have to fix the file links for
         the new location, e.g. via "Find and replace" =M-%= with find:
         - in the org file e.g. find =[[file:./data/= and replace with =[[=
         - in the html file e.g. find =./data= and replace with =.=
** Organization of git

*** remote/origin/main branch:
  - contains all the source code in folder **src/** which is used for experiments.
  - contains the **LabBook.org** template
  - contains setup- and metadata files such as **MLproject** or **conda.yaml**
  - the log contains only lasting alterations on the folders and files mentioned
    above, which are e.g. used for conducting experiments or which introduce new
    features. Day-to-day changes in code
*** remote/origin/exp### branches:
  - if an experiment is done, the code and templates will be branched out from
    *main* in an *#experiment-name* branch, ### meaning some meaningful
    descriptor.
  - all data generated during the experiment (e.g. .csv files, plots, images,
    etc), is stored in a folder with the name **data/#experiment-name**, except
    machine learning-specific data and metadata from `mlflow` runs, which are
    saved under **data/mlruns** (this allows easily comparing machine learning
    runs with different experimental settings)
  - The **LabBook.org** file is essential
    - If possible, all code is executed from inside this file (meaning analysis
      scripts or calling the code from the **scr/** directory).
    - All other steps taken during an experiment are noted down, as well as
      conclusions or my thought process while conducting the experiment
    - Provenance data, such as Metadata about the environment the code was
      executed in, the command line output of the code, and some
*** remote/origin/develop branch:
  - this is the branch I use for day to day work on features and exploration.
    All of my current activity can be followed here.
*** remote/origin/data branch:
  - contains a full cronicle of the whole research process
  - all *#experiment-name* branches are merged here. Afterwards the original
    branch is deleted and on the data branch there is a *Git tag* which shows
    the merge commit to make accessing single experiments easy.
  - the *develop* branch is merged here as well.

Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing.

   - I committed the correlations to the git repository, since the file size is
     rather small (~5kB / correlation, makes ~15kB per file)
   - I sorted the correlations according to the 3 things I did with the .ptu
     data and the correlation method
     1. *No correction*: I just read in the .ptu data and correlated the photon
        arrival times using the =tttr2xfcs= algorithm
     2. *Corrected with weights*: I read in the .ptu data, constructed a
        timetrace from it, fed the time trace to my trained unet which predicts
        bright burst artifacts, then mapped the time trace prediction on the
        photon arrival times and /gave all photons inside a bin labelled as
        artifactual a weight of 0/ in the =tttr2xfcs= algorithm
     3. *Corrected by photon deletion with shift*: I read in the .ptu data,
        constructed a timetrace from it, fed the timetrace to my trained unet
        which predicts bright burst artifacts, then mapped the time trace
        prediction on the photon arrival times and /deleted all photons inside a
        bin labelled as artifactual and the arrival times of all photons which
        come after a deleted bin by the bin size/, then I correlated the
        resulting new photon arrival times using the =tttr2xfcs= algorithm
   - Then I fitted the traces in each of the 3 folders using Dominic Waithe's
     https://dwaithe.github.io/FCSfitJS/

   - So the first analysis of "no correction" vs "weight=0" vs "delete and
     shift" did show that the two correction methods did not work properly.
     Another approach is photon weighting, so let's look at the following
     correlations:
     1. *no correction*: I just read in the .ptu data and correlated the photon
        arrival times using the =tttr2xfcs= algorithm → taken from first
        experiment
     2. *weight=0*: I read in the .ptu data, constructed a timetrace from it,
        fed the time trace to my trained unet which predicts bright burst
        artifacts, then mapped the time trace prediction on the photon arrival
        times and /gave all photons inside a bin labelled as artifactual a
        weight of 0.2/ in the =tttr2xfcs= algorithm
     3. *weight=0.2*: changed weight to 0.2, else see above
     4. *weight=0.4*: changed weight to 0.4, else see above
     5. *weight=0.6*: changed weight to 0.6, else see above
     6. *weight=0.8*: changed weight to 0.8, else see above
   - Then I fitted the traces in each of the 3 folders using Dominic Waithe's
     https://dwaithe.github.io/FCSfitJS/
   - now let's look at the results:
