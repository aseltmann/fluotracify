* Technical Notes
** README
*** General:
   - This file corresponds to my lab book for my doctoral thesis tackling
     artifact correction in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)
     measurements using Deep Neural Networks. It also contains notes taken
     during the process of setting up this workflow for reproducible research.
   - This file contains explanations of how things are organized, of the
     workflow for doing experiments, changes made to the code, and the observed
     behavior in the "* Data" section.
   - The branching model used is described in [[http://starpu-simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/misc/SIGOPS_paper.pdf][this paper]]. Therefore: if you
     are interested in the "* Data" section, you have to =git clone= the /data/
     branch of the repository. The /master/ branch is clean from any results, it
     contains only source code and the analysis.
   - This project is my take on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science][Open-notebook science]]. The idea was postulated in
     a blog post in 2006:
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     ... there is a URL to a laboratory notebook that is freely available and
     indexed on common search engines. It does not necessarily have to look like
     a paper notebook but it is essential that all of the information available
     to the researchers to make their conclusions is equally available to the
     rest of the world ---Jean-Claude Bradley
     #+END_QUOTE
   - Proposal on how to deal with truly private data (e.g. notes from a
     confidential meeting with a colleague), which might otherwise be noted in a
     normal Lab notebook: do not include them here. Only notes relevant to the
     current project should be taken
*** Code block languages used in this document

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     # This is a sh block for shell / bash scripting. In the context of this file,
     # these blocks are mainly used for operations on my local computer.
     # In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     # light green colour (#F0FBE9)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC tmux
     # This block can open and access tmux sessions, used for shell scripting on
     # remote computing clusters.
     # In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     # distinct light green colour (#E1EED8)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     # This is a python block. In the context of this file, it is seldomly used
     # (only for examplary scripts.)
     # In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     # light blue colour (#E6EDF4)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session /jpy:localhost#8889:704d35be-572a-4268-a70b-565164b8620f
     # This is a jupyter-python block. The code is sent to a jupyter kernel running
     # on a remote high performance computing cluster. Most of my jupyter code is
     # executed this way.
     # In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     # light orange colour (#FAEAE1)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; This is a emacs-lisp block, the language used to customize Emacs, which is
     ;; sometimes necessary, since the reproducible workflow of this LabBook is
     ;; tightly integrated with Emacs and org-mode.
     ;; In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a
     ;; light violet colour (#F7ECFB)
   #+END_SRC

   #+begin_example
     This is a literal example block. It can be used very flexibly - in the context
     of this document the output of most code blocks is displayed this way.
     In the LabBook.html rendering of this document, these blocks will have a light
     yellow colour (#FBFBBF)
   #+end_example

*** Experiments workflow:
   1) Create a new branch from =master=
   2) Print out the git log from the latest commit and the metadata
   3) Call the analysis scripts, follow the principles outlined in
      [[* Organization of code]]
   4) All machine learning runs are saved in =data/mlruns=, all other data in
      =data/#experiment-name=
   5) Add a "** #experiment-name" section to this file under [[* Data]]
   6) Commit/push the results of this separate branch
   7) Merge this new branch with the remote =data= branch

**** SSH tunneling
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ssh-tunneling
    :END:

    Different applications can be run on the remote compute node. If I want to
    access them at the local machine, and open them with the browser, I use this
    tunneling script.

    #+NAME: ssh-tunnel
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session org-tunnel :var port="8889" :var node="node001"
    ssh -t -t ara -L $port:localhost:$port ssh $node -L $port:Localhost:$port
    #+END_SRC

    Apps I use that way:
    - Jupyter lab for running Python 3-Kernels
    - TensorBoard
    - Mlflow ui

**** jupyter scripts
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: scripts-jp
    :END:

    Starting a jupyter instance on a server where the necessary libraries are
    installed is easy using this script:

    #+NAME: jpt-tmux
    #+BEGIN_SRC tmux :socket ~/.tmux-local-socket-remote-machine
    conda activate tf-nightly
    export PORT=9999
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=''
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=""
    jupyter lab --no-browser --port=$PORT
    #+END_SRC

    On the compute node of the HPC, the users' environment is managed through
    module files using the system [[https://lmod.readthedocs.io][Lmod]]. The =export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR= statements
    are needed because of a jupyter bug which did not let it start. Right now,
    =ob-tmux= does not support a =:var= header like normal =org-babel= does. So
    the =$port= variable has to be set here in the template.

    Now this port has to be tunnelled on our local computer (See
    [[#ssh-tunneling]]). While the tmux session above keeps running, no matter if
    Emacs is running or not, this following ssh tunnel needs to be active
    locally to connect to the notebook. If you close Emacs, it would need to be
    reestablished

*** Setup notes
**** Setting up a tmux connection from using =ob-tmux= in =org-babel=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sec-tmux-setup
    :END:
    - prerequisite: tmux versions need to be the same locally and on the server.
      Let's verify that now.
      - the local tmux version:

        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        tmux -V
        #+END_SRC

        #+RESULTS:
        : tmux 3.0a

      - the remote tmux version:

       #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session local
        ssh ara tmux -V
      #+END_SRC

        #+RESULTS:
        | ye53nis@ara-login01.rz.uni-jena.de's | password: |
        | tmux                                 | 3.0a      |

    - as is described in [[https://github.com/ahendriksen/ob-tmux][the ob-tmux readme]], the following code snippet creates
      a socket on the remote machine and forwards this socket to the local
      machine (note that =socket_path= was introduced in tmux version 2.2)

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session local
      REMOTE_SOCKET=$(ssh ara 'tmux ls -F "#{socket_path}"' | head -1)
      echo $REMOTE_SOCKET
      ssh ara -tfN \
          -L ~/.tmux-local-socket-remote-machine:$REMOTE_SOCKET
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      | ye53nis@ara-login01.rz.uni-jena.de's | password:                            |           |
      | /tmp/tmux-67339/default              |                                      |           |
      | >                                    | ye53nis@ara-login01.rz.uni-jena.de's | password: |

    - now a new tmux session with name =ob-NAME= is created when using a code
      block which looks like this: =#+BEGIN_SRC tmux :socket
      ~/.tmux-local-socket-remote-machine :session NAME=
    - Commands can be sent now to the remote tmux session, BUT note that the
      output is not printed yet
    - there is a workaround for getting output back to our LabBook.org: A [[#scripts-tmux][script]]
      which allows to print the output from the tmux session in an
      =#+begin_example=-Block below the tmux block by pressing =C-c C-o= or =C-c
      C-v C-o= when the pointer is inside the tmux block.

**** =emacs-jupyter= Setup

    =Emacs-jupyter= aims to be an API for a lot of functionalities of the
    =jupyter= project. The documentation can be found on [[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter][GitHub]].

    1. For the *whole document*: connect ot a running jupyter instance
       1. =M-x jupyter-server-list-kernels=
          1. set server URL, e.g. =http://localhost:8889=
          2. set websocket URL, e.g. =http://localhost:8889=
       2. two possibilities
          1. kernel already exists $\to$ list of kernels and =kernel-ID= is displayed
          2. kernel does not exist $\to$ prompt asks if you want to start one $\to$
             *yes* $\to$ type kernel you want to start, e.g. =Python 3=
    2. In the *subtree* where you want to use =jupyter-python= blocks with =org
       babel=
       1. set the =:header-args:jupyter-python :session
          /jpy:localhost#kernel:8889-ID=
       2. customize the output folder using the following org-mode variable:
          #+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
            (setq org-babel-jupyter-resource-directory "./data/exp-test/plots")
          #+END_SRC

          #+RESULTS:
          : ./data/exp-test/plots
    3. For each *individual block*, the following customizations might be useful
       1. jupyter kernels can return multiple kinds of rich output (images,
          html, ...) or scalar data (plain text, numbers, lists, ...). To force
          a plain output, use =:results scalar=. To show the output in the
          minibuffer only, use =:results silent=
       2. to change the priority of different rich outputs, use =:display=
          header argument, e.g. =:display text/plain text/html= prioritizes
          plain text over html. All supported mimetypes in default order:
          1. text/org
          2. image/svg+xml, image/jpeg, image/png
          3. text/html
          4. text/markdown
          5. text/latex
          6. text/plain
       3. We can set jupyter to output pandas DataFrames as org tables
          automatically using the source block header argument =:pandoc t=
       4. useful keybindings
          - =M-i= to open the documentation for wherever your pointer is (like
            pressing =Shift-TAB= in Jupyter notebooks)
          - =C-c C-i= to interrupt the kernel, =C-c C-r= to restart the kernel

** Organization of git
*** remote/origin/master branch:
  - contains all the source code in folder **src/** which is used for experiments.
  - contains the **LabBook.org** template
  - contains setup- and metadata files such as **MLproject** or **conda.yaml**
  - the log contains only lasting alterations on the folders and files mentioned
    above, which are e.g. used for conducting experiments or which introduce new
    features. Day-to-day changes in code
*** remote/origin/exp### branches:
  - if an experiment is done, the code and templates will be branched out from
    *master* in an *#experiment-name* branch, ### meaning some meaningful
    descriptor.
  - all data generated during the experiment (e.g. .csv files, plots, images,
    etc), is stored in a folder with the name **data/#experiment-name**, except
    machine learning-specific data and metadata from `mlflow` runs, which are
    saved under **data/mlruns** (this allows easily comparing machine learning
    runs with different experimental settings)
  - The **LabBook.org** file is essential
    - If possible, all code is executed from inside this file (meaning analysis
      scripts or calling the code from the **scr/** directory).
    - All other steps taken during an experiment are noted down, as well as
      conclusions or my thought process while conducting the experiment
    - Provenance data, such as Metadata about the environment the code was
      executed in, the command line output of the code, and some
*** remote/origin/develop branch:
  - this is the branch I use for day to day work on features and exploration.
    All of my current activity can be followed here.
*** remote/origin/data branch:
  - contains a full cronicle of the whole research process
  - all *#experiment-name* branches are merged here. Afterwards the original
    branch is deleted and on the data branch there is a *Git tag* which shows
    the merge commit to make accessing single experiments easy.
  - the *develop* branch is merged here as well.

*** Git TAGs
**** Stable versions:
**** All tags from git:
   #+begin_src sh :results output
    git push origin --tags
    git tag -n1
   #+end_src

    1. We see some interesting results in the *corrupted data without
       correction* (first box, in blue), can they be explained by the test data?

       - subsets which look like the bright clusters lead to a shift in the
         correlation curves towards their own transit time:
         - 0.069=163.35ms: cluster speed 1.0=11.27ms, median correlated speed
           11.6ms
         - 0.08=140.89ms: cluster speed 0.1=112.71ms, median correlated speed
           100.5ms
         - 0.6=18.79ms: cluster speed 1.0=11.27ms, median correlated speed
           12.10ms
         - 10=1.13ms: cluster speed 0.1=112.71ms, median correlated speed 92.1ms
         - 50=0.23ms: cluster speed 0.1=112.71ms, median correlated speed 96.5ms
       - subsets which fall out of the pattern where I have to take a closer
         look:
         - 0.1=112.71ms: cluster speed 0.01=1127ms, median correlated speed
           346.6ms → possible explanation: it is a rule of thumb in the FCS
           community, that you need around 2-3 orders of magnitude of
           measurement time longer than transit times you want to measure. For
           speeds of 1.13s that means measurement times of 113-1130s, where we
           are far away from with our simulated ~16s of trace.
         - 0.2=56.36ms: cluster speed 0.1=112.71ms AND 1.0=11.27ms, median
           correlated speed 73ms
           → possible explanation: there seem to be two maxima in the
           distribution, one around 10ms, one around 70-110ms, which kind of
           fits to the two kinds of clusters in these traces.
           → another strange thing: it has a quite long tail of transit times,
           way over 200ms, which does not seem related to the direct cluster
           speeds.
         - 0.4=28.18ms, 1.0=11.27ms and 3.0=3.76ms: cluster speed 0.01=1127ms
           AND 1.0=11.27ms, median correlated speed 14.4ms → strange case, since
           the traces with the slower 0.01 clusters do not show up in the
           distribution! The log of =isfc.import_from_csv= shows, that the
           respective files were loaded and used for these plots.
    2. Looking at the *predictions* (and controls)
       - subsets which look fine, as in: predictions ~ controls
         - 0.069, 0.08, 0.2, 0.6
       - subsets where there seem to be a subsubset of traces where the
         prediction fails:
         - 0.1: median is fine, but the distribution is a lot wider, including a
           considerable left-ward skew, which does not show in either of the
           other distributions (corrupted or controls)
         - 0.4: median is fine, distribution is also okay, but a subset of
           traces gets very low transit times after correlation → have to figure
           out which subset this is
         - 1.0, 3.0: median is fine, but distribution has a considerable left-ward
           skew, and quite some outliers on the right
         - 10, 50: median and distribution are okay, BUT here there is quite a
           difference between the distribution in predictions, label control and
           pure control → here, most clearly in 50, it seems artifacts are
           introduced through the correction method.

    Awesome! Now let's try categorical plotting to examine the results in a more
    structured manner. For the following 3 plots, I just changed the =x= value.

    I have the theory, that trace lengths have quite an impact on transit times
    and diffusion rates. Let's try to do a big plot of transittimes vs trace
    lengths and diffusion rates against trace lengths.

      predictions = model_keras.predict(test_features, verbose=0)
      predictions = predictions.flatten()

    1. Test the algorithm: here it can be seen, that in the ideal case, the
       metadata from the single files is joined to each computation. For the
       computation of all traces, this will probably not be possible, because
       of traces, which get omitted before correlation, because their trace
       lengths shrank below 32 time steps after correction. This small traces
       can't be handled by multipletau.

    - while loading data, the subsample folder was loaded even though it should
      not have been → move it out of the main folder.
    - in the end, 3 folders would be good: =Nov2020-train=, =Nov2020-test=,
      =Nov2020-subsample= (subsample is used for quick prototyping)
    - also, I will need *3 .csv files per simulated diffusion rate*, because I
      want to test the algo on each of the 3 different cluster speeds

    - *NOTE: I accidentally deleted set004 (0.01) from 0.069 test file. That
       means the only remaining simulated file with D=0.01 has to be taken for
      test (set009) and there is NO training set for 0.01 cluster speed at 0.069
      molecule speed. Also, there is no training set for 0.1 clusters and 0.1
      molecules (sad!), because there was only one simulated one.*

    We loaded the correlation results from the saved out .csv file and looked at
    where it failed. All the cases where basically all the trace was
    (wrongfully) removed, was at a very slow simulated cluster speed (0.01) and
    a rather high simulated speed of the molecules we are interested in (10
    and 50).

    Awesome! Now let's try categorical plotting to examine the results in a more
    structured manner. First, plot the trace lengths.

    #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python
      x = 'Trace lengths'

      g = sns.FacetGrid(data=corr_out,

                        height=5,
                        legend_out=True)
      g.map_dataframe(sns.boxplot,
            x=x,

      g.add_legend(title='Simulated $D_{{clust}}$')
      g.map_dataframe(sns.stripplot,
            x=x,
            y='Traces used',
            hue='Simulated $D_{{clust}}$',
            dodge=True,
            palette=sns.color_palette(['0.3']),

    Then, plot the diffusion rates and transit times. Since they follow a log
    normal distribution, use a log scale.

    looks good! Open question: why were metadata not saved? Since I started
    handling multipletau failures better (they now return np.nan values for the

    3. Check out nan values

    We see, that all of the 31 NaNs happened in the "clean" dataset with a
    prediction threshold of 0.1 and all were presumably caused by the
    insufficient trace length, since multipletau needs in this case 32 time
    steps to correlate the trace.
